# Extracting knowledge from multi-omics and clinical datasets using effective graph autoencoders
Cluster patient based on their multiomics data utilizing graph autoencoders

## About the project
Project based on pytorch-geometric.
### 1. Generate a patient similarity graph. 
Transform omics data into binary or numerical features and preselect them. 
Generated patient nodes have an edge connecting them if their distance in the feature space is below a set threshold.
### 2. Train graph autoencoders 
GAE are graph convolutional nets that integrate feature and adjacency information. The resulting latent represenation is decoded to reconstruct the adjacency 
information and the loss is the mean squared error between the original matrix and the reconstructed one.
Various architectures from the pytorch geometric project are included and they all result in a latent representation after training.
### 3. Clustering analysis for the latent represenation of the patient 
The latent represenation can the be projected via an dimensionality reduction (UMAP) and clustered (DBSCAN)
